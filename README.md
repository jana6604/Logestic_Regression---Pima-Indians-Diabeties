# Logestic_Regression---Pima-Indians-Diabeties

Diabetes Prediction – Pima Indians Dataset

This project applies Machine Learning models to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

The goal is to compare the performance of different classification models:

🔹 Logistic Regression (LR)

🌲 Random Forest (RF)

🌳 Decision Tree (DT)

📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains medical predictor variables such as:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Target variable:

1 → Diabetic

0 → Non-Diabetic

🚀 Workflow

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Loaded dataset

Handled missing/invalid values

Feature scaling & train-test split

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Heatmap for correlation

Feature importance analysis

3️⃣ Model Building

Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

Trained models using scikit-learn

4️⃣ Evaluation

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Comparison of models

📈 Results & Visuals

✅ Logistic Regression: Interpretable with coefficients & good baseline accuracy

🌳 Decision Tree: Captured non-linear patterns

🌲 Random Forest: Best accuracy among models
